# 🎧 CANIG — Screen Sound Recorder

**CANIG** is a lightweight web application that allows you to **record system/screen audio directly in your browser** — no installation required.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, CANIG runs entirely on the client side, meaning your recordings never leave your device.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Click **Start Recording**  
2. Choose the screen, window, or tab you want to record  
3. Enable the **"Share audio"** checkbox when prompted  
4. After recording, click **Stop**  
5. You can then **Play** or **Download** your recording locally  

> ⚠️ Note: Some browsers (like Chrome/Edge) only allow system audio recording from a shared tab — make sure “Share audio” is checked in the permission popup.
